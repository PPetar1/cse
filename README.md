A combat simulation engine/wargame centered around WW2 written in Rust

Side project, worked on in free time

First goal is to enable scenario loading, save/load, some map visualisation from terminal, simple move/attack commands to aid development/testing
Next goal after that is to work on the battle resolution engine which is the main focus of the project


Commands:
new g - start a new game on an example map
inspect x y - inspect the location at x, y
inspect offmap-location-name - inspect the offmap location with the given name
exit
